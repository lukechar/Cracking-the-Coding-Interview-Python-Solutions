# 3-1: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

# A single array could simply be divided into three different parts to create three different stacks.
# This question is likely more profound in languages where memory is manually-allocated, like C.

# In Python and other languages where memory is automatically managed for, and largely hidden to, the coder, 
# creating 3 stacks in one array (i.e. list) doesn't seem to be very useful.
